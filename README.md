## Key insights

### Actionable Insights:
**Sales trends:**
<br>
Walmart does not exhibit a clear upward or downward trend in sales during the observation period. However, seasonality is evident from line plots. Seasonal sales peaks are observed in May, August, and toward the end of the fourth quarter.
<br>
<br>
**Holiday impacts:**
<br>
The data reveals that holidays impact Walmart's sales, with sales increasing by approximately 7.31% during holiday weeks compared to non-holiday weeks. 
<br>
<br>
**Performance rankings:**
<br>
The top 10 stores and top 10 departments were identified based on their total weekly sales:<br>
Top 10 stores are store number: 20, 4, 14, 13, 2, 10, 27,6 ,1 and 39. <br>
Top 10 departments are department number: 92, 95, 38, 72, 90, 40, 2, 91, 13 and 8. <br>
Sales from the top 10 stores account for 39% of Walmart's total sales (\$2.63B / \$6.74B *100), which is significant given the dataset includes only 45 stores. The rankings for the top departments within the top 10 stores are consistent with the overall top 10 department rankings, confirming their performance across locations.
### Recommendations:
The results indicate that Walmart relies heavily on sales from the top 10 stores and top 10 departments. As such, ensuring smooth operations in these top-performing stores and maintaining adequate inventory levels for the top-performing departments should be a primary focus for Walmart.
<br>
<br>
The data also suggests that Walmart has a tendency to scale down the size of its stores. However, the size of a store shows a weak positive correlation with sales, indicating that larger stores generate more sales. Walmart may need to reconsider its strategy regarding store size to maximize sales potential.
<br>
<br>
External factors such as temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate do not have significant impacts on Walmartâ€™s business performance. However, seasonality is evident in the data. To optimize inventory and revenue, Walmart should stock up inventory before May, August, and the last quarter of the year, when seasonal sales peaks are observed.
